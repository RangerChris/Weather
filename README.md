# Weather App

This is a simple example of how to create a weather app using react typescript and tailwind.

Please note that a API key is needed and must be created in a file called .env.local and contain the following:

VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key

Replace the key value from <https://www.weatherapi.com> where you have to request an api key.
